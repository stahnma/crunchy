What is it
----------

  Berry is a wrapper for the irc bot rbot.  It is written as a wrapped to allow for the "piratization" of the bot's speech.

How to use it
-------------

  The berry package has a scripted install.  The install script creates a user to the daemon, sets up config files, and starts rbot for the first time.  Once rbot is launched for the first time, it runs through it's own config procedure.

Berry sets up a init.d script and can auto-start on system start.

Oh, and it's all a hack.
