   a. The first time rbot is run under a given user, a wizard will run.  At this point you can set the rbot
      password and tell it what channel to join.
      i. You have a few options here, a password that allows you to max out your authorization with
         the bot, the default authorization users have (used when executing rbot commands), non
         nick-matching prefixes (set ! here), language, server, port, password, nickname, user name,
         and the channel to join at startup.
      ii. All of these things are stored in the .rbot directory under the users's home in the
         conf.yaml directory.
7. write init.d script to run 'berry -b' as rbot user upon system restart. 


berry.rb will have to go in /usr/local/bin...put library files in /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/berry/?
