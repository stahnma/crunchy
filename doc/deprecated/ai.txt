Mission:
--------------
The AI portion of crunchy is really just for entertainment.  I have looked at
 a couple of different AI engines to accomplish this.

Engines:
-------------
1. Alice
   a. I have looked at alice using http://www.pandorabots.com to host the bot
      and using Ramblurr (http://github.com/Ramblurr/rbot-alice/) to interact
      with it.  The downside is that we would have a dependency on pandoranots
      and they can be flaky at times.  You can chat with the bot I created by 
      going to (http://pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b6b051057e374a27).  
      I looked around trying to find a decent ruby
      (http://aiml-programr.rubyforge.org/) or C based alice implementation,
      but I have not found one.  Some bots are listed at
      (http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/programs.html).
2. Megahal
   a. What scott originally used.  Not the greatest, but may still be the best
      bet for us to use.
3. Jabberwacky
   a. Only pay versions are available.
4. Eliza
   a. Eliza is kind of old and boring.
