So, you want to write a plugin?  It's easy.  

Parts of a plugin
-----------------
A plugin should consist of a class that inherits from the "Plugin" class and a short section of rbot code that registers the plugin.  Including a help method allows the bot to answer when a user requests help on your plugin.  You can register a plugin to reply to a specific command or you can specify regex to match to.  Take a look at the berry plugins to see examples.
